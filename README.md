## About Us

The UW BioHealth and Health Sciences Journal Club comprises of faculty (Dr. Narveen Jandu, Dr. John Mielke, Dr. Diane Williams) and students to create an open space for journal article discussion! Scientific papers are an age old tradition and the primary mechanism for scientific communication. Students will discuss key areas in the health sciences by reading and discussing scientific literature under the supervision of a faculty member.  

No experience is needed to participate! Just a curiosity for science!

Light refreshments will be provided!

## Our Vision

- Create an open space to meet new people and professors in the Faculty of Health!
- Recieve mentorship directly from faculty members!
- Inspire the future of BioHealth researchers!
- Reduce inequality in Science.

## Expectations

- Members are expected to read the paper before the meeting as an important part of participation and strengthen discussion.
- Have fun!
